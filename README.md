# About

FChannel is a [libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), [self-hostable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)), [federated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)), [imageboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard) platform that utilizes [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/).

There are currently two instances federated with each other: https://fchan.xyz and https://0x00000000.xyz

There is an anon testing FChannel instances on TOR/Loki/I2P. Find more information here: https://fchan.xyz/g/MORL0KUT
It is a testing envirmoent, so the instances might come and go.

## To Do List
Current things that will be implemented first are:
- A way to automatically index new instances into a list so others can discover instances as they come online. 
- Setting up a server proxy so that clearnet instances can talk to TOR/Loki/I2P instances. 
- Other improvements will be made over time, first it needs to be as  easy as possible for new instances to come online and connect with others reliably.

Try and run your own instances and federate with one of the instances above.
Any contributions or suggestions are appreciated. Best way to give immediate feedback is the Matrix channel #fchan:matrix.org

# Server Installation and Configuration

## Minimum Server Requirements

- golang v1.11+
  
- postgresql
  
- redis

## Server Installation Instructions

- Ensure you have golang installed at a correct `GOPATH`

- Copy `config-init` to `config` and change the values appropriately to reflect the instance.

- Create the database, user name, and password for psql that is used in config file.

- Run `psql -U (user) -d (database) -f databaseschema.psql`

- Finally start the server with `go run`.

## Server Configuration

### config file

  `instance:fchan.xyz`  Domain name that the host can be located at without www and `http://` or `https://`
  
  `instancetp:https://` Transfer protocol your domain is using, should be https if possible. Do not put `https://` if you are using `http://`
  
  `instanceport:3000`   Port the server is running on locally, on your server.
  
  `instancename:FChan`  Full name that you want your instances to be called.
  
  `instancesummary:FChan is a federated image board instance.` Brief description of your instance.


  `dbhost:localhost`    Database host. Most likely leave as `localhost`.
  
  `dbport:5432`         Port number for database. Most likely leave the default value.
  
  `dbname:fchan_server` Database name for psql.
  
  `dbuser:admin`        Database user that can connect to dbname.
  
  `dbpass:password`     Database password for dbuser.


  Currently e-mail is not implemented to do anything special, but the code is in place
  
  `emailserver:mail.fchan.xyz`
  
  `emailport:465`
  
  `emailaddress:contact@fchan.xyz`
  
  `emailpass:password`


### Creating a new board

  `CreateNewBoardDB(db *sql.DB, actor Actor)`
  
  returns Actor.
  
### Creating a new actor

 `CreateNewActor(board string, prefName string, summary string, authReq []string, restricted bool)`
 
 returns Actor
 
 - `board` is the abbreviated name such as `g`
 
 - `prefName` is the fully readable name such as `Technology`
 
 - `summary` is a summary of the board
 
 - `authReq` is an array string of required privileges to post on the board, default is: `[]string{"captcha","email","passphrase"}`
 
 - `restricted` is bool. `true` is blue board, `false` is red board
 

## Server Update

 Check the git repo for the latest commits. If there are commits you want to update to, pull and restart instance.

## Networking

### NGINX Template

Use [Certbot](https://github.com/certbot/certbot), (or your tool of choice) to setup SSL.

```
server {
        listen 80; 
        listen [::]:80;

        root /var/www/html;

        server_name DOMAIN_NAME;

        client_max_body_size 100M;

        location / {
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
                #try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
                proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
}
```

#### Using Certbot With NGINX

- After installing Certbot and the Nginx plugin, generate the certificate: `sudo certbot --nginx --agree-tos --redirect --rsa-key-size 4096 --hsts --staple-ocsp --email YOUR_EMAIL -d DOMAIN_NAME`

- Add a job to cron so the certificate will be renewed automatically: `echo "0 0 * * *  root  certbot renew --quiet --no-self-upgrade --post-hook 'systemctl reload nginx'" | sudo tee -a /etc/cron.d/renew_certbot`
